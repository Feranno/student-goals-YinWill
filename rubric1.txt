Goal 1: Doing well in extracurriculars by practicing everyday and slowly improving until competition dates. 

Rubric:
- 4: Getting a high enough place in prestigious competitions to create a name for myself and be known as skilled in my extracurricular; practicing every single day for that activity!
- 3: Doing well in extracurriculars but not putting as much time as I want to 
- 2: An average competitor in my extracurriculars with an average skill level compared to others 
- 1: Low skill level, the joke of the extracurricular; no experience or prestige.
