Goal 2: Gaining good grades by focusing on school work and academics and studying everyday 

Rubric:
- 4: High enough grades where I do not worry so much about school and focus more on extracurriculars!
- 3: Above average grades where I can focus on extracurriculars but if I ever have assessments, I focus primarily on that.

- 1: Below my expectation grades that I will skip all extracurriculars for until they are at my desired grade.
